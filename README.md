# Snapper!

_Make windows snappier!_

## Introduction

Have you ever been annoyed by how Windows doesn't have a snap top or snap bottom, but does have snap left and snap right? Well I sure was, so I made a small application to do it for me!

## Build Requirements

This project was made with Visual Studio 2017, so to build it you'll need some kind of Visual Studio (probably at least 2017). Alternatively, you can use .NET Core (conversion of `.csproj` required with `try-convert` or manually).

## Usage

Once running use `Ctrl + Alt + Up` or `Ctrl + Alt + Down` to snap the focussed window to the top of the screen or the bottom respectively.

## Additional Credits

The lineart for the application icon is by Freepik from flaticon.com, some colouring in on my part.

Also pinvoke.net was super useful for reference on how the heck to call certain native functions from Câ™¯.
